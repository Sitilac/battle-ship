### Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them.

## <span style="text-decoration: underline">Starting the Game</span>

* The game starts out with the player grid and your ships on the right.
* Once a ship is selected click on the grid in order to place down the ships either horizontally or vertically
* Once finished the hit grid will appear on the left hand side. This will be used so the player may attack the computer's ships.
* When the computer or player hits all opposing ships that side wins and the game is over.

### I plan on adding drag and drop to the ships in order to give maximum control to the player as well as speed up the placing of ships.
