## <span style="text-decoration: underline">Starting the Game</span>

* The game starts out with the player grid and your ships on the right.
* Once a ship is selected click on the grid in order to place down the ships either horizontally or vertically
* Once finished the hit grid will appear on the left hand side. This will be used so the player may attack the computer's ships.
* When the computer or player hits all opposing ships that side wins and the game is over.

## <span style="text-decoration: underline">Planned Features</span>

### I plan on adding drag and drop to the ships in order to give maximum control to the player as well as speed up the placing of ships. This will also allow me to use actual ship images as well.
